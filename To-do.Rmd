## Things to do:

* Improve on the boxplot output in **generic.1factor.ANOVA**
* Some sort of decent report output from **ANOVA_Chem_examples**
* Fully document what is going on in **ANOVA2**, does it have lab application?
* Fully document what is going on in **ANOVA.playing**, (From Alex's text book) does it have lab application?
